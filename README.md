## What is medicant?

Medicant is a real-time telemedicine application with artificial intelligence integration to help remote diagnosis.


## How to use?

To use medicant you have to create an account. There are accounts for doctors and patients as well. After the registration you can login and use the application.

There are three major functions in the application. You can create, join or schedule an examination (meeting). There are further functions for doctors. They can create and manage custom examination protocols which they can use during the examinations. They can also add notes to the video and they can switch on and off the AI metrics functions. Conference call alike examinations are also available.


## How to install?

At the moment medicant is in the state of a Flutter project. If you know how to run or build Flutter projects you can try out medicant as well. The project targets to be platform independent.

In the near future medicant will be available in the Ant Media Marketplace. You can install it from there.


## Legal notices

The intended use of medicant is a telemedicine application for remote diagnosis between doctors and patients. We strongly recommend making a call with partners only, who have proved their own identity, for example with your real doctor and patients. Do not trust meeting links that you have taken via email, message application, phone call, etc from a person who is unfamiliar to you. Medicant does not check the identity of users, neither doctors nor patients. Medicant does not check or follow any health condition of a patient. Do not share any private information with an unauthorized person. Be careful making calls just as you are during any personal doctor-patient visits. As a doctor, you shall protect the health and personal data of your patients similar to a common in person visit. As a doctor, you shall inform your patient about the steps of diagnosis or using any AI assistance or any other important steps that need to be consented to by your patient.
